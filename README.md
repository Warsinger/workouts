# Apple Workouts Data Parser
Parser for Apple Watch workout data generated by an app I found that exports the data as CSV files. 
This only parses the *Workout* portion that the app can download. All CSV files in the directory will be parsed, but empty files will be ignored, as will file that only contain *User Entered* data.
Combines the data from the separate files into a single file with the field names being the ones that are common across all files with data.
## App
CSV download app for Apple HealthKit data

# Usage
Use the app to download your workout data as a ZIP file and open the zip. The app stores it in your iCloud files, so you can easily get it from there.

The parser script takes only one parameter that is the directory containing the downloaded CSV files.

```/usr/bin/python3 /Users/matthewlee/dev/workouts/workoutparser.py ~/Downloads/workouts```

Output is a file in the current directory `health_output.csv`. This file can be opened or imported into Excel or any other tool for analysis.

# Analysis
I used Excel to import the data (live query using Power Query so it can be easily refreshed). I created a Pivot Table and Chart that plots the energy, duration, and Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET). This is a measure of the work required and increases with the intensity.
