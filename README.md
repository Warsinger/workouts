# workouts
Parser for Apple Watch workout data generated by an app I found that exports the data as CSV files. 
This only parses the *Workout* portion that the app can download. All CSV files in the directory will be parsed, but empty files will be ignored, as will file that only contain *User Entered* data.
Combines the data from the separate files into a single file with the field names being the ones that are common across all files with data.

# Analysis
I used Excel to import the data (live query using Power Query so it can be easily refreshed). I created a Pivot Table and Chart that plots the energy, duration, and Metabolic Equivalent of Task (MET). This is a measure of the work required and increases with the intensity.
